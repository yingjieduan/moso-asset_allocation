# moso-asset_allocation
In this module, some of the asset allocation algorithms in quantitative finance are implemented. Including Tangency Profolio Model, Black Litterman Model, Minimum Variance Portfolio Allocation etc.

The functions can be directly used to construct your own fund in terms of various target you take. But before using them, please understand the theory back them, otherwise you may have unexpected lose. I will write some bloger to explain how to use them and reengineering the code if I have spare time. Thanks! 

This module is a by-product of learning CQF (Certificate in Quantitative Finance). As said by an old Chinese phrase “饮水思源” (remember where one's happiness comes from), thanks CQF institution.
